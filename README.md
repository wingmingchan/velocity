# Velocity

Library last modified: 2/24/2017 9:00 AM.

A reusable library in Velocity for Cascade with examples. This is the code base I use to implement our <a href="https://github.com/wingmingchan/RWD2">RWD2</a>. To download the implementation of the Standard Model, go to RWD2.

A note about filenames. All files whose filenames with a "chanw_" prefix contain code reusable by anyone. Those with the "upstate_" prefix contain business logic specific to Upstate.

Since some macros are contributed by Peter Thomas, there are some minor inconsistency in formatting and naming conventions.

To upgrade the library, use the web service program <a href="https://github.com/wingmingchan/velocity/blob/master/library/upgrade_standard_model.php">upgrade_standard_model.php</a>. Before running the program, make sure that the $site_name variable is assigned the correct value to match the name of the site to be upgraded. Since the library can be upgraded in this way, I won't update the code posted here too frequently. For the newest version of the library, see <a href="http://www.upstate.edu/cascade-admin/standard-model/source/index.php">Source</a>.
