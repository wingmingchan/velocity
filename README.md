# velocity
A reusable library in Velocity for Cascade with examples. This is the code base I use to implement our RWD2.

A note about filenames. All files whose filenames with a "chanw_" prefix contain code reusable by any one. Those with the "upstate_" prefix contain business logic specific to Upstate.
