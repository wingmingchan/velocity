# Velocity
A reusable library in Velocity for Cascade with examples. This is the code base I use to implement our RWD2.

A note about filenames. All files whose filenames with a "chanw_" prefix contain code reusable by anyone. Those with the "upstate_" prefix contain business logic specific to Upstate.

Since some macros are contributed by Peter Thomas, there are some minor inconsistency in formatting and naming conventions.
