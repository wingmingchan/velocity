Questions for the audience:

1. Can you define the internal structure of the DEFAULT region of a template
   in the template? And can you move elements out of DEFAULT and
   insert them into other regions?
2. Can you attach a block to region A to swap the hierarchical order of region B
   and region C, to add a new region D, or to remove region E?
3. Can you configure a template, so that the same template can be used to
   publish a full page as well as partial page? For example, only the header,
   only the footer, or only the content of the page WYSIWYG?

The problems with templates and regions:

1. Templates: using a linear (textual) order to mimic a hierarchical structure
2. A template is not represented by Cascade API and cannot be maniplulated programmatically
3. Regions: lack of internal structures
4. Mixing data with presentation: XHTML structure is presentational
5. Lack of flexibility, configurability, inheritance, reusability, and partiality
6. Lack of communication among page parts
