Questions for the audience:
================================================================================
1. Can you define the internal structure of the DEFAULT region of a template
   in the template? And can you move elements out of DEFAULT and
   insert them into other regions?
2. Can you attach a block to region A to swap region B and region C,
   to add a new region D, or to remove region E?
3. Can you configure a template, so that the same template can be used to
   publish a full page as well as partial page? For example, only the header,
   only the footer, or only the content of the page WYSIWYG?
4. Can you add a new region to a page at the page level,
   without affecting all other pages associated with the same content type? 

The problems with templates and regions:
================================================================================
1. Templates: text files, are not represented by Cascade API,
   and cannot be maniplulated programmatically
2. Regions: lack of internal structures
3. Mixing data with presentation: XHTML structure is presentational
4. Lack of flexibility, configurability, inheritance, reusability, and partiality
5. Lack of communication among page parts
6. Proliferation of configuration sets and content types

Demo (site configurations):
================================================================================
1. standard-model: partial pages
2. java:           folder nav on the right
3. web-services:   adding prefooter
4. formats:        swapping the header and the footer
