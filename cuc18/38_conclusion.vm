The tree approach:
================================================================================
1.  A specific output of a tree is basically a template without regions
2.  A single tree can produce indefinitely many XHTML structures,
    rooted at various elements
3.  Trees are truly hierarchical and can be manipulated programmatically
4.  A node can contain any presentational logic
5.  Blocks can be attached to nodes
6.  Nodes can be moved around freely, including nodes defined for DEFAULT
7.  Communication among nodes is facilitated, and one node can change
    the bahaviar of another node
8.  Trees and tree parts are reusable
9.  Both fully rendered pages and partial pages can be produced
10. Inheritance and configurability
11. Because any XHTML structures can be created in a tree,
    only one configuration set is needed per file extension,
    only one content type is needed for all publishable pages per file extension,
    and there is no more switching of content types
12. Implementing a new design is to create a new presentational layer
    to be associated with sites and pages, and NO new content type is needed
13. Sites, pages and blocks are data containers; data within can be updated,
    but containers are never rebuilt simply because a new look is needed
14. Implementing a new design â‰  (NOT EQUAL TO!) rebuilding sites and pages
15. There is no smart way of rebuilding sites and pages;
    rebuilding them for a new look is just dumb

Who can do better than this?
