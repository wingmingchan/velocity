# Velocity: Hannon Hill

I put the formats used to implement the Hannon Hill site here. The new idea I am experimenting is to use formats for site configuration. To understand how it works, start with the default format (default.vm) and the setup format (master-setup.vm). For an example of a setup format used in a site (placed in the Base Folder), see https://github.com/wingmingchan/velocity/blob/master/custom/setup.vm
