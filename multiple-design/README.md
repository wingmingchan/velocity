# One Master Site, Multiple Designs

Here I post the code I have been writing related to the one-master-site, one-region-template, multiple-design approach.

<ul>
<li>dd_rwd.xml: this is the data definition used by pages</li>
<li>default.vm: this is the format attached to the DEFAULT region</li>
</ul>
